# Recall Squirrel Overview
recall-squirrel is a CLI app (command-line application) designed to help users efficiently study and track their progress through various flashcard-based learning techniques. It supports both a traditional CLI mode (Click) and an interactive dashboard mode (Textual), allowing users to choose their preferred interface.

The app offers multiple study modes, including free recall, multiple-choice quizzes, and adaptive testing, while also implementing advanced answer matching (exact matching, NLP-based similarity). User performance is tracked in detail, with response times, accuracy trends, and optional spaced repetition insights.

Users can manage their flashcards with categories, difficulty ratings, and study sets, and have the ability to import/export their data in CSV/JSON formats.
